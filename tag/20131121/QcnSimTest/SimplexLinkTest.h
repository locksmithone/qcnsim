// This sample shows how to write a simple unit test for a function,
// using Google C++ testing framework.
//
// Writing a unit test using Google C++ testing framework is easy as 1-2-3:


// Step 1. Include necessary header files such that the stuff your
// test logic needs is declared.
//
// Don't forget gtest.h, which declares the testing framework.
